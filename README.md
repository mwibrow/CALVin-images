# CALVin images

This repository contains the source SVG
images originally created for use with
[CALVin](https://github.com/mwibrow/CALVin).

## Details

The SVGs were created with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/)
and then processed with [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo)
to remove all the Inkscape cruft.
